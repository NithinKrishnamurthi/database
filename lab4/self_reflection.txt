All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I basically did most of what they did.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I sort of abstracted out the method add and remove like them.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: THe way I implemented the add and remove was pretty inelegant; I could have cut out two functions.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Resize doesn't need to happen at exactly 16, it can happen earlier if you want it to.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I probably would just use one pointer that pointed to the start of the list; the lastItem pointer is useless: it can be found with start + size mod length.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: N/A

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I broke everything up well and got the solution that they were basically looking for.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: N/A

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Resize doesn't need to happen at exactly 16, it can happen earlier if you want it to.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: N/A

Meta:

Q: This is the first time we've tried something like this. Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I think this was mostly pretty useless, being honest. I think posting a solution online would be a lot more effective.
